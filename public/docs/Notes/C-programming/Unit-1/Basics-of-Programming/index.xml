&lt;p&gt;We think programming is the process of making programs, well its true that goal of programming is to make programs but Programming is much more then that, It is &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt; we love and hate it time to time, when program is working perfectly we admire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs are made for a purpose and programmers job is to find a way to full file those purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://v2k-veetokay.github.io/Learn_From_me/docs/Notes/C-programming/Unit-1/Basics-of-Programming/112.-Use-of-high-level-programming-language-for-systematic-development-of-programs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2k-veetokay.github.io/Learn_From_me/docs/Notes/C-programming/Unit-1/Basics-of-Programming/112.-Use-of-high-level-programming-language-for-systematic-development-of-programs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="use-of-high-level-programming-language-for-systematic-development-of-programs"&gt;Use of high level programming language for systematic development of programs&lt;a class="anchor" href="#use-of-high-level-programming-language-for-systematic-development-of-programs"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when computers first appeared, programs were written on punch cards (sheets of stiff paper with holes punched to represent data). Early machines used vacuum tubes; these were later replaced by transistors. Transistors enabled the creation of registers and other compact circuitry, which eventually led to integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These circuits perform calculations by taking inputs as 0s and 1s. Binary is hard for humans to read, so we encoded binary as hexadecimal. Later we created an abstraction over 0s and 1s called assembly language. Assembly made programming faster, but its learning curve was steep and writing large programs remained difficult. High-level programming languages were then developed—Fortran, COBOL, Lisp, BASIC. &lt;strong&gt;In 1972 at Bell Labs, &lt;em&gt;Dennis Ritchie&lt;/em&gt; created a legendary language: C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://v2k-veetokay.github.io/Learn_From_me/docs/Notes/C-programming/Unit-1/Basics-of-Programming/113.-Concept-of-algorithm-and-flowchart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2k-veetokay.github.io/Learn_From_me/docs/Notes/C-programming/Unit-1/Basics-of-Programming/113.-Concept-of-algorithm-and-flowchart/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="concept-of-algorithm-and-flowchart"&gt;Concept of algorithm and flowchart&lt;a class="anchor" href="#concept-of-algorithm-and-flowchart"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
